![Headless Drupal](http://davidhwang.github.io/horseman/logo.svg)

## A Manifesto

- We want to build a Drupal that is not only friendly to designers and front-end developers, but rather a _preferred_ choice.

- We believe that Drupal's main strengths lie in the power and flexibility of its backend, and that its primary value to users is the ability to architect and display complex content models.

- We believe that client-side front end frameworks are the future of the web

- It is critically important for Drupal to be services oriented first, not HTML oriented first, or risk becoming irrelevant.
